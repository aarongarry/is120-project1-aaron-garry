# is120-project1-aaron-garry

It was hard to make the header background color take up al the space 
learned to use vertical align for socials in footer
hover over image and use the image as a link
Hard to put text floating somewhere on the page
played around with two colums and percentages after a disaster with relative and absolute going off page. Still not super happy with it and this page overall. 
After I had to look it up but found a way to get an underline under skills. Hard to center it and used margin align again...
